Ocean circulation and its variability span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. This research combines satellite observations — including sea surface temperature, ocean color, and satellite altimetry (with applications of SWOT) — in-situ measurements, and numerical models to investigate the dynamics of boundary currents, mesoscale and submesoscale processes, and their role in shaping large-scale ocean circulation.

Understanding how energy, heat, and tracers are redistributed by ocean dynamics is central to improving our understanding of the global ocean circulation system.

**Work in progress..**

I am working Guoqi Han, Tetjana Ross, and Jody Klymak looking at glider data, SWOT observations, and simulations to better understand the stirring of heat, nutrients, and biological components from the coastal domain to the open ocean.
