Ocean circulation and its variability span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. My research combines satellite observations — including sea surface temperature, ocean color, and satellite altimetry (including high-resolution SWOT data) — and in-situ measurements to investigate the dynamics of **shelf-ocean boundary regions, from western boundary currents to eastern boundary upwelling systems. Understanding how **exchanges between the continental shelf and open ocean influence ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, biogeochemical balances, and heat budgets is central to improving our understanding of the global ocean system.

## Current Position

I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** in Physical Oceanography at the [**University of Victoria**](https://www.uvic.ca), funded by the **Canadian Space Agency** and **Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)**. I work with Dr. Jody Klymak, Dr. Tetjana Ross, and Dr. Guoqi Han as part of the [**Ocean Physics Group**](https://ocean-physics.seos.uvic.ca/~jklymak/pages/people.html) and the [**Canadian-Pacific Robotic Ocean Observing Facility (C-PROOF)**](https://cproof.uvic.ca).

My research focuses on understanding the lateral transport and stirring of heat, nutrients, and biological components from coastal regions to the open ocean in the Northeast Pacific. I combine **autonomous underwater glider observations from C-PROOF's fleet with **satellite remote sensing (ocean color, sea surface temperature, and altimetry) to characterize mesoscale and submesoscale ocean dynamics. In particular, I work with high-resolution altimetry data from the **SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) mission to resolve fine-scale ocean features and mixing processes that are critical for understanding upper ocean physical and biological processes.


## Background

I completed my PhD in Oceanography at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, where I studied cross-shelf exchanges in the Southwestern Atlantic shelf and their role in transporting water masses and biogeochemical properties between the shelf and open ocean regions.
